# RandomPredictor

If you let a person give you ten random numbers, in the range of [1, 10], with repetition, are the outcome array indeed independent identically distributed samples from the pool?

What if human generated randomness is not random? Is there a pattern to the human generated random (HGR) samples?

# Theorem
My hypothesis theory is that there is a non-normal distriubtion to HGR-samples. 

Using ML, I want to answer the question:
<b Is there a non-normal distribution to human-generated-random samples? >

And additionally, I want to study the following:
- What is the distribution of the HGR-samples
- Can I model a sochastic model, where given i-th sample, I can predict the i+1-th sample with some probability
